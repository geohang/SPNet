# SPNet
The codes are used in paper *Deep learning for locating contaminated sites from self-potential signals: a laboratory perspective*.

## Description

SPNet is an useful tool to predict locations of SP sources, which helps to monitor and locate contaminated sites and address environmental problems. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Download the python package described in *requirement.txt*.
- Windows 10
- Matlab 2020a

### Codes
- SPinversion.py: The main program to train the SPNet with normalized SP signal with regarding sources. 
- testdatasets.py: Codes for evaluating the SPNet with test datasets
- plotdata.py: Example of 3D plot in this paper. In this code, the lab test dataset is used.
